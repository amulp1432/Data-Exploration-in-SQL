# Data-Exploration-in-SQL for coronavirus(COVID-19)Deaths
1. I have downloaded this datasets from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
2. I have downloaded this datasets for Canada,Germany, France,India,United Kingdom and United States.
3. I have categorized the whole data into two tables.
   * Covid_deaths: This table has 26 columns
   * Covid_vaccinations: This table has 45 columns
 Based on the datasets, I have calculated these things from covid analysis
*  Question: 
1)	Looking at total_cases vs total_deaths
2)	Looking at total_cases vs population
3)	Looking at the country with highly affected by the people.
4)	Showing countries with the highest death count per population
5)	Showing the population who have received at least one covid cases
6)	Using CTE to perform the calculation  on a partition by in the previous query
7)	Using TEMP table to perform a calculation on a partition by in the previous query
